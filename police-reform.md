#### Truths about police reform
1. Body cams don’t reduce police violence [*](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10329.short?rss=1)
2. There is no evidence that better police training programs or “implicit bias” training changes police behavior. 
    * The trainings vary in quality and rarely result in any accountability/changes in decision-making. 
3. More restrictive policies governing "use of force" significantly lower rates of police shootings/killings by police. 
   * This is backed by 30+ years of research. 
4. Demilitarization. Police departments that get more military weapons from the federal government kill more people. [*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017712885?fbclid=IwAR0eny_l7gSJnpGK3AnPSERTbVK_jg9KjTe9Cwi4Mj-XRKEwRiB05TTrmWQ)
5. Police Union Contracts. [*](https://www.checkthepolice.org/?fbclid=IwAR3O-iRdHr7Zh82I2EGrOUxtp9w9hqsd9oncxE0Yaone2gzWsFCkPlyCYNg)
   * Every 4-6 years your police department’s accountability system is re-negotiated. 
   * Cities with worse contracts have higher police violence rates. 
   * Each cycle:
     * Purges misconduct records
     * reinstates fired officers
     * reinstates department funding 
6. Predictive policing on the police. [*](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-predicting-bad-police-behavior-20190801-xumudeezmjalbbpmqwyvh26tdi-story.html?fbclid=IwAR2q5D5iIqQMONrMP8cbpnQ71FoxVCFRRQvyoHH14yMgvLA1Pb2R1Vtroh8)
   * Data on use of force, complaints and lawsuits can be used to identify officers who are most likely to shoot someone next and prevent it from happening.
7. Invest in alternatives to police as crime prevention strategies. [*](https://journals.sagepub.com/d…/abs/10.1177/0003122417736289)
   * Every 10 additional organizations in a city reduces the murder rate by 9%,violent crime rate by 6%; and property crime rate by 4%.
8. Establish non-police alternatives to 911 calls involving people with mental illness. [*](https://www.wsj.com/…/when-mental-health-experts-not-police…)
9.  initiate more investigations of police departments.[*](https://www.vice.com/…/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-t…)
    * Resource the Department of Justice (after the current president is voted out) 
    * Departments that receive federal intervention have 25-30% fewer police shootings than those that do not. 
    
#### List or effective policies in regard to use of force
1. require officers to de-escalate situations
   * communice with subjects
   * maintain distance
   * eliminate the need to use force
2. Don't Allow officers to choke or strangle civilians where less lethal force could be used instead
    * Could result in the unnecessary death or serious injury of civilians
3. Require officers to intervene and stop excessive force used by other officers and report these incidents immediately to a supervisor 
4. Restrict officers from shooting at moving vehicles
    * This is regarded as a particularly dangerous and ineffective tactic
5. Develop a Force Continuum
    * limits the types of force and/or weapons that can be used to respond to specific types of resistance 
6. Require officers to exhaust all other reasonable means before resorting to deadly force
7. Require officers to give a verbal warning, when possible, before shooting at a civilian
8. Require officers to report each time they use force or threaten to use force against civilians

#### Use of lethal force stats
* Victims were majority white (52%) but disproportionately black (32%) 
* A fatality rate 2.8 times higher among blacks than whites.
* Most victims were reported to be armed (83%); however, black victims were more likely to be unarmed (14.8%) than white (9.4%) or Hispanic (5.8%) victims.
* about 22% of cases were mental health related; 
* 18% were suspected “suicide by cop” incidents, with white victims more likely than black or Hispanic victims to die in these circumstances; 
* 14% involved intimate partner violence; 
* about 6% were unintentional deaths due to Law Enforcement action. 
* 53% of cases were unclassified and did not fall into a coded subtype. [*]

#### Death by police
* 1000 people are killed by cops in America each year. 
* There are about 50 to 60 million encounters between civilians and cops each year
* There are about 10 million arrests each year. 
* Your chance of dying in an arrest is around 1/10,000. [*](https://samharris.org/can-pull-back-brink/)
