# Bacon's Rebellion's effect on freedom/slavery/race
* Thousands of Virginians of all classes and races (including slaves / indentured servants) rose up in arms against the English Governor who was dismissive of their demands of aid for trade/war against natives
* The English saw the alliance of slaves and poor whites as a threat so they created the `Virginia Slave Codes of 1705` 
* The slave codes were meant to: 
  * establish more control over blacks
  * keep whites and blacks segregated so they are less likely to unite

# Creation of Whiteness by Virginia Slave Codes of 1705
> Before the slave codes white indentured servants and black slaves were both treated equally poor. These codes put distinctions based on skin color into law, giving new rights to whites and explicitly barring rights from blacks.
* Created separate courts for blacks/whites
* Established free/legal trade of black people
* Whites could not be employed by blacks
* illegal for black people to own arms
* Future iterations of this policy would also induct Irish and Jews into the club of white.

# Dealing with Race
* Mind
  * Learn a lot of facts
  * Try and establish strategies to alleviate racism
* Body
  * Learn to listen to the body
  * Creates anti-racist cultures
  > Racist organizations like the KKK are good at creating culture/symbols/music/ belonging. These are highly effective at converting lost 13-year-old white boys.

# Body conditioning for race conversations
* When in conversations or situations relating to race take notice of your body.
  * Pause. stay there. and see what comes next.
  *  notice the rage, the silence, the chest, etc.
* Learn how all of this lands in the body so that you can become conditioned in order to hold race.
* Conditioning, like running a marathon, takes time and practice
* White people don't have to deal with race so they're not conditioned well for it. 
* You have to create condition in the culture.
  > After you experience pain either you're going to get back up and put another rep in or you're going to put the book away and never pick it up again... and nobody will ever know. 

# Race and the Body
* Vegas Nerve (Wandering Nerve/ Soal Nerve) 
  * Able to notice the state of other bodies
  * It answers the question "Am I safe?"
* Boaz (beast muscle) 
  * Controls whether you brace for flight or fight.
* Reticular Activation System
  * System that notices information once it's deemed relevant.
